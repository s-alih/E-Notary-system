the platform will issue Soul Bound Token to the users in return just after
registration completes which will act as an on-chain Digital Identity
DigiSign platform will also help in e-signing agreements between two
parties.
>>DigiSign platform will also be giving on-chain roles for users, lawyers/courts,

uploaded by lawyers/court workers on IPFS and later they will share a link
to two parties who are willing to sign the notary
